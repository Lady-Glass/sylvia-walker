<tr><td>1</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">She inhales, slow and deep, and tugs the folds of her cloak about her shoulders. Nodding slightly, she leans into her stride, and pushes on down the path.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">Her pace is steady and her treads are heavy, days of exhaustion weighing her down. Stride by stride, she passes by the endless ranks of dead brush.</span>&quot;</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">She stifles a yawn as she walks, then her eyes light up with an idea. She wets her lips with her tongue, then starts whistling.</span>&quot;</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The tune tugs at your memory, bright and quick, punctuated by her stride. A love song, maybe? You're not certain.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The last notes fade on the wind as she reaches the end of the song. Her gaze is soft and warm, and her pace is renewed, even happy to be walking.</span>&quot;</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The crunch of her boots on the gravel is bleakly repetitive. She toys with the idea of picking up a pebble or bit of dirt, unsure if she wants to do it.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>13</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">Ranks of dead brush fade over the south horizon as she walks, and ranks of dead brush appear over the north horizon to match. Nothing changes.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">She leans into her stride and pushes on. Nothing changes.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The world is painted in strokes of faded browns and greys like a lazy watercolor. Nothing changes as she walks.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">With nothing to do, she takes a mental inventory of her possessions. Over the past few weeks of walking, she has shed her belongings, one by one, down to her waterskin. She is left with nothing but the clothes on her back and a keen knife which she keeps in her boot.</span>&quot;</td></tr>

<tr><td>19</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The oak beams are rotted and weak. She briefly wonders whether she could pull a piece free, then shrugs without breaking stride.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">As she walks, she looks up at the clouds and tries to guess where the sun would be, but realizes she hasn't known what time of day it is for hours.</span>&quot;</td></tr>

<tr><td>23</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">She finds her gaze wandering as she continues, idly passing over the rails, the ground, the brush, the sky, her tunic and cloak. Her boots continue their rhythmic crunch in the white gravel.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">Her legs ache. The reeds rustle in the breeze. The rail beckons heartlessly onward.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">She starts humming, and her throat cracks with dryness. She pushes forward down the path.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The same song she whistled earlier, she hums now as she carries on. The freedom it had when she whistled is gone now. It is heavier, slower, breaking in her throat.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">Her footfalls mark the time, her strained humming carrying a fracturing tune. The wind's whistle is harsh and mocking.</span>&quot;</td></tr>

<tr><td>34</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">She rolls her shoulders, sighs, and leans back into her stride. The path stretches on ahead.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>35</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The rustling of the reeds is almost like a conversation at the edge of her hearing, almost like whispers she cannot understand.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>36</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The reeds whisper. Maybe they're mocking her. Maybe they're in awe of her. She cannot know.</span>&quot;</td></tr>

<tr><td>40</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The wind subsides, just a little, and the whispering of dead reeds stops. The whistling of the air over the dust does not.</span>&quot;</td></tr>

<tr><td>50</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">There is no food, no water, and no end. There is the whistle of the wind and the whisper of the reeds and the rhythm of her gradually slowing stride.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>51</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">They say death is eternal and unchanging. What is this, then? The question is plain to see in her face, in the furrow of her brow and the dullness of her eyes.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">She wonders about death, as she walks. They say it's like a dreamless sleep. But she hasn't dreamed in longer than she can remember.</span>&quot;</td></tr>

<tr><td>60</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'And what if you're not?' There is a sigh, and she looks back at the ground, then back at the sky. She trembles, her teeth clenched. She does not move.</span>&quot;</td></tr>

<tr><td>69</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The wind picks up behind her, blowing at the edges of her cloak, shoving her forward so she stumbles. The reeds take up a dry, whispery chorus. There is no doubt now that the voices of the dead are whispering in awe.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>70</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The brightness grows as she surges forward on staggering legs. The hope that there might be blue in the sky again is written in her eyes.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>71</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The world is a blur of brown under a blur of grey with a single stripe of gold and white, far to the north. A lazy watercolor, maybe, but one with hope in it.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>72</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">'One foot in front of another,' she pants, reminding herself with every stride. The splintering rail ties under her feet creak and snap as she passes over them, giving up their lives in her wake.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>73</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">The brightness is so close, but there is still no end to the rail in sight. Sylvia takes a deep breath and keeps walking.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>74</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">A second brightness appears on the horizon, the brightness of sunlight reflected in water. Her eyes widen. 'Please,' she gasps between two heavy steps.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
