She called herself Cheshire, because she came and went mysteriously, whenever and wherever she wanted - she was very rich, you see, and so she could have whatever she wanted.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">Cheshire owned research corporations and secret laboratories, factories and shipyards, and no one ever met with her in person. Her representatives were few and secretive as well, often leaving a trail of bodies as they went about their business. No one could get to the bottom of her network.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>&quot;<span class="quote">But Cheshire couldn't abide the idea of a perfect secret, because then no one could know how clever she'd been to set it all in motion. So, like notes in bottles, Cheshire scattered hints about herself throughout books and stories, waiting to see if someone would find her.</span>&quot;</td></tr>
